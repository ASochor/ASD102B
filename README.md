# ASD102B
Individual Case Project
This is a class project for course ASD102B at California Institute of Arts and Technology. This project is to build on the skills taughts from ASD101A-B (Python) and
ASD102A-B (HTML, CSS, JAVA) This project is a website that consists of at least four (4) pages with a common layout and navagation system. A mathematical calculation based
feature must be added on one page that requires users input. Also incorperate if, if else, and/or else if statements, or by a switch statement.

THIS README FILE WILL LAYOUT THE FOLLOWING:
1. A comprehensive stylesheet css format for every page
2. Integration of Python coding language (More to follow on that)
3. HTML 5 language 
4. Java scripts that are polished but are not too in depth.
5. Anything I decide to add later on.

My goal with this project is to create something from scrath and have it fully functioning in 4 weeks.
